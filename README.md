# rwdpa – ABDANDONED Project

[![Project Status: Abandoned – Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

**NOTE**: This project has been abandoned because in the mean time another client for the WDPA API has been developped:

* [`wdpar`](https://github.com/prioritizr/wdpar) which is on CRAN and let's you use the API directly while returning `sf` objects,
* [`rWDPA`](https://github.com/ljvillanueva/rWDPA) which is a simpler client of the API.

The goal of rwdpa is to provide an R interface to the [WDPA API](https://api.protectedplanet.net/).
You need to have a token given by the WDPA to use the functions in this package.

## Installation

You can install rwdpa from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rwdpa/Rekyt")
```
